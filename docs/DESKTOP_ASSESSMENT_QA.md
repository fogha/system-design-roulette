# Native assessment verification — 2026-09-09

The packaged macOS app was tested through its native window at `tauri://localhost`,
using Rust IPC and SQLite. The isolated identifier was
`com.darkmatter.principia-desk.assessment-qa`; production data was not opened or
modified. A SQLite backup of the prior design QA profile supplied a v2 upgrade
fixture. Fixed local questions and future `PRINCIPIA_DATE` values kept the test separate
from existing study records. `--debug-day` disabled kiosk and scheduler changes.
Provider executables were unavailable stubs, with no live grading calls.

## Verified journeys

- Opening the v2 fixture applied migration v3, retained its original quiz config
  bytes and created a pre-upgrade backup. SQLite integrity returned `ok`, with no
  foreign-key violations after the UI journeys.
- A legacy round with two confirmed answers reopened in the original node-panel
  quiz layout with Review answers and Grade saved answers. Grading showed the
  first review item; a full app restart restored that result and the second item
  remained accessible.
- A new three-question round combined due carryover and fresh questions. Custom
  answer buttons saved choices, and confirmation advanced to the next question.
- Free text containing punctuation and `Grüße` saved without confirmation. SQLite
  retained it as a draft at revision 5 with no submission. After terminating and
  relaunching the native executable, the app restored question 3 and the exact
  draft. The already-confirmed answers remained saved.
- Confirming that restored draft created one submission at revision 6. Grader
  failure showed self-assessment mode and stored the free-text verdict as `null`;
  the two deterministic choice answers retained their actual verdicts. No new
  round, draft or result was written through the retired config keys.

The new saved-round state was visually inspected at 1100 × 760. It preserves the
blueprint background, centered node panel, status badge and amber action styling.
Custom dropdown design and minimum-window checks are recorded separately in
[desktop design verification](DESKTOP_DESIGN_QA.md).
This build also rechecked the German start-level menu: the opaque app popup opens
above its trigger, shows the saved A2 checkmark, and Arrow Down followed by Escape
closes the menu with A2 still selected.

## Automated checks and limits

170 Rust tests and 40 frontend tests pass. Six live/external Rust tests are
explicitly ignored. Svelte reports zero errors/warnings; strict local Clippy and
the production frontend/packaged app build pass. Tests include stale writes,
changed answers during grading, owner isolation, immutable results, injected
transaction failures, legacy import and local recovery conflicts.

This verifies the primary assessment adapter on macOS. Shared session identities,
diagnostic placement UI, acceptance into an active class, classroom/language
runtime migration, Windows/Linux operation, live providers and enforcement remain
separate implementation and release gates.


## Diagnostic and suggested-path increment

The same isolated macOS profile was rebuilt and tested with the native placement
commands. Linux Bash restored a selected but unconfirmed answer after terminating
and relaunching the app. Keyboard selection, confirmation, skips, previous-answer
navigation, initial submission and both optional follow-up questions worked. The
result distinguished demonstrated samples, practice needs and unassessed criteria.
A corrected follow-up retained the original failed response in expandable evidence.

The resulting path preview proposed Practical application with 3 of 6 sampled
criteria demonstrated, five prerequisite refreshers, eleven earlier topics still
available and the required course outcome intact. It explicitly identifies
unsampled/practical/retention knowledge and pending activation. Both the check and
recommendation were visually inspected at 1100 × 760 with the original blueprint,
node panels and amber controls. SQLite integrity returned `ok`, with no foreign-key
violations. No class or accepted path was created.

Current checks: 176 Rust tests and 43 frontend tests pass, six external/live Rust
tests are ignored, Svelte has zero errors/warnings, strict Clippy and the packaged
macOS build pass. All nine authored banks and all three recommendation routes are
covered by domain/preview tests. This does not establish calibrated placement,
active-class path acceptance, practical assessment or Linux/Windows operation.

## Accepted paths and revised class tutors

The isolated profile was upgraded from v4 to v5 using the packaged macOS app.
The pre-upgrade backup was retained; SQLite integrity returned `ok` and the
foreign-key check returned no violations. Production data was not opened.

- Linux Bash restored its completed diagnostic and proposed Practical application
  with 3 of 6 sampled criteria and five prerequisite refreshers. Accept path enabled
  the class and displayed Path 1 while keeping coverage at 0 of 18 concepts.
- Revise starting point opened a fresh draft seeded from the accepted choices.
  The native custom dropdown selected Core mechanisms; the shared runner selector
  selected OpenRouter and its saved `openrouter/free` model without entering a key
  or making a provider request. The two-model shortlist remained accessible.
- Accepting the revision kept the same class and displayed Path 2 with the new
  tutor. The first diagnostic/path remained stored. Acceptance created no lessons,
  mastery or completion credit: the QA profile still had zero classroom/language
  sessions and its original single mastery row from the earlier assessment fixture.
- Settings and enrollment were visually checked at 1100 × 760. Primary, secondary,
  library and dropdown controls share subtle rounded corners with the panels.

The first rebuilt launch showed a blank native window before rendering.
The external Google Fonts stylesheet has since been replaced with bundled fonts;
this removes an external resource from the startup path. The final packaged build
rendered on the first observation after a fresh launch and restored Linux Bash
Path 2 with its OpenRouter model. This does not establish timing guarantees for
every machine or eliminate every possible startup delay.

Automated checks cover all nine course acceptances, all seven engineering entry
selectors, stale recommendations, rollback on injected write failure, duplicate
acceptance, immutable prior revisions, settings rollback and language reassessment
during an active lesson. 197 Rust and 51 frontend tests pass, six external Rust
tests remain ignored, Svelte has zero errors/warnings and strict Clippy passes.
This is still a bridge to existing session adapters, not the completed shared
learning runtime or a cross-platform release qualification.

## Shared runtime schema upgrade

Built the packaged debug app with identifier
`com.darkmatter.principia-desk.assessment-qa` and upgraded that isolated profile
from schema v5 to v6. Production data was not opened. The v5 backup was readable,
SQLite integrity returned `ok`, and foreign-key checking reported no violations.

Before/after ordered-row hashes matched for all 14 checked tables: primary,
classroom and language sessions; courses; all four assessment tables; enrollment
drafts; classes; path revisions; mastery; exercise drafts; and course snapshots.
The profile retained four primary sessions, three documents, four assessment
attempts, five rounds/submissions, four enrollment drafts, one class, two accepted
path revisions and one pre-existing mastery row. New runtime session count was
zero, as expected before engine cutover.

The direct background-binary launch initially displayed a blank native window.
Live process samples showed idle event loops in the app and WebContent; the
database upgrade was already complete. The UI appeared by the time the native
Web Inspector opened, and its console showed no error messages. This observation
does not prove what caused the delay. After quitting that process, a normal macOS
Launch Services launch rendered at the first observation and restored the Classes
view, Linux Bash Path 2/Core mechanisms, and `openrouter/free`. Learning-table
hashes still matched after relaunch. No provider calls or new study credit were
needed for this check.

Validation logs: `/tmp/principia-study-all-tests.log` (208 passed, six external
tests ignored), `/tmp/principia-study-clippy.log`, and
`/tmp/principia-study-native-build.log`. Isolated before/after fingerprints are in
`/tmp/principia-study-native-before.json` and
`/tmp/principia-study-native-after.json`. The new runtime is covered through its
native domain and storage tests; existing UI commands still use the legacy
engines, so this check verifies upgrade compatibility, not completed engine
integration or cross-platform runtime behavior.

## Primary identity and reader restart

Used a separate profile, `com.darkmatter.principia-desk.primary-id-qa`, copied with
SQLite's backup API from the earlier isolated v6 assessment profile. Added only
synthetic QA rows: a prepared September 19 JavaScript reader and a separate
September 20 TypeScript pending row. Launch Services started the packaged app
with `PRINCIPIA_DATE=2026-09-20`, disabled Claude/Codex executables and `--debug-day`.
This is a controlled service-date test, not a timezone/DST test.

The v7 upgrade retained a v6 backup, generated distinct primary IDs, passed SQLite
integrity and foreign-key checks, and restored the September 19 reader. Normal
Quit initially revealed two debug-mode restrictions: native close/quit guards
and the webview's Cmd-Q interceptor used the simulated lock. Both were corrected.
Only the synthetic reader's counter was reset between these QA attempts.

With the final build, Cmd-Q terminated the process while the reader was still
unfinished. SQLite contained 17 saved seconds and the same session ID. A fresh
launch restored that lesson and continued its remaining time; after the timer
reached zero, the native Complete session button changed September 19 to
`completed` / `done` with 30 debug seconds. September 20 remained `pending` /
`quiz` with zero seconds. The UI correctly showed that next day as still due.

Prepared course bytes, all four assessment tables, classes and path revisions
retained their pre-test hashes. The original assessment profile and production
learner data were not edited. The new shared-runtime table still has zero rows:
this test exercises the primary compatibility command boundary, not the future
FSM/content migration.

Evidence: `/tmp/principia-primary-native-before.json`,
`/tmp/principia-primary-native-quit.json`,
`/tmp/principia-primary-native-completed.json`,
`/tmp/principia-primary-native-build.log`, `/tmp/principia-primary-tests.log`,
`/tmp/principia-primary-clippy.log`, `/tmp/principia-primary-ui-check.log` and
`/tmp/principia-primary-ui-tests.log`. Automated results: 211 Rust tests passed,
six live/external tests ignored, 52 frontend tests passed, no Svelte diagnostics,
and strict Clippy passed.

The final feedback integration was also checked in the packaged desktop app under
`PRINCIPIA_DATE=2026-10-03`: it restored the existing three-item review directly from
native storage, displayed the saved `let` answers and moved to the second item.
Cmd-Q exited normally. Screen components now remount on owner changes; a frontend
regression rejects out-of-order refresh replies and foreign timer events. Reader
admission tests verify that duplicate starts share one worker and use the latest
persisted counter. The reader ignores a late preparation reply after unmounting.

After the final timer-admission change, a fresh October 4 fixture started at
seven saved seconds under an October 5 clock. Cmd-Q exited at 25 seconds. Relaunch
finished the remaining five seconds; Complete session changed only October 4 to
completed with 30 seconds. October 5 stayed pending at zero, and both IDs were
unchanged. The app then restored the older October 3 unfinished review, which is
also retained in this QA profile. Integrity and foreign-key checks passed.
Evidence: `/tmp/principia-primary-final-before.json`,
`/tmp/principia-primary-final-quit.json` and
`/tmp/principia-primary-final-completed.json`.

## Shared-runtime engineering lesson — 2026-09-10

Isolated profile `com.darkmatter.principia-desk.qa`, upgraded v7→v8 on launch with
a pre-upgrade backup and `integrity_check` = `ok`; `--debug-day`; the tutor
executable overridden with `/usr/bin/false` so no provider ran.

- TypeScript (active, 09:00 weekdays, no chosen starting point) → Learn now:
  a foundations path and class row were created, the session was planned for
  "Structural typing and excess property checking", preparation failed with
  "agent exited with status 1", and the header showed Retry preparation and
  Discard lesson while the sidebar read In progress. Discard lesson left the
  session `skipped` and its preparation job `cancelled`.
- With the app closed, `study_fixture` planned a new session and published the
  bundled "Contextual typing and bidirectional inference" lesson (three checks).
  After relaunch the header offered Resume; the lesson rendered with
  `v1 · qa-fixture` provenance, the accepted-path framing and the frozen check.
- Question 1 by pointer, question 2 by keyboard (deliberately wrong), question 3
  by keyboard: `assessment_work` held revision 3 with answers `0,1,0`.
- Cmd-Q with the lesson open, relaunch, Resume: the saved answers were restored
  on screen. A reflection was typed and the check submitted: the session became
  `completed` at revision 5, `study_results` stored the 67% result and the
  reflection, `classroom_exit_attempts` held three rows (two correct) keyed by
  the study session, one assessment submission existed, the attempt was
  `completed`, and the concept's mastery row read `practicing` with one encounter.
- Progress showed one completed session, TypeScript at 1 completed, the fixture
  lesson with a readable link and 67%, and the discarded lesson as Skipped.

Not covered here: live generation into the runtime, reading-position restore,
language lessons (still legacy), Windows/Linux, enforcement. Screenshots for this
pass were kept under `/tmp/principia-shots/` (20, 24–28, 30).

Reading-position follow-up on the same profile: a second fixture lesson
("Session 2", concept `ts-unknown-any-never`) was scrolled to its first check
question, the app was quit, and `study_checkpoints` held revision 1 with stage
`practice` and reading offset 4420. Relaunch and Resume reopened the lesson at
the exercise hints with the check just below (screenshot 31).

Language lesson on the shared runtime (same profile, 2026-09-10): German gained a
10:00 study time and was activated; Learn now with the failing stub tutor
published the curated A1 seed (`curated` provenance) into an active session and
rendered the mission, dialogue player and five checks. Two answers saved at
revision 2; the session stayed active and resumable after leaving the screen.
After relaunch and Resume, focusing a visible radio by accessibility and using
Tab/Space selected the remaining three answers (revision 5); a German writing
response was typed and CHECK ANSWERS AND RECORD PRACTICE (pressed through the
accessibility action) completed the session at revision 7: `study_results`
held a 0.38 result with `passed` false and current level A1, the checkpoint kept
the writing response, `language_unit_progress` gained one encounter without pass
credit, `language_skill_scores` recorded listening, reading,
vocabulary/pragmatics and writing, and a second assessment submission existed
(screenshots 33, 35, 36).

Legacy compatibility on the same profile: a hand-inserted in-progress
`classroom_sessions` row for JavaScript (two questions, `qa-legacy` source)
resumed from the class header on the legacy screen (`classroom.javascript.v1 ·
qa-legacy`), accepted keyboard answers and completed through the compatibility
submit: the row became `completed` with score 1.0, two `classroom_exit_attempts`
rows kept their legacy `session_id`, no study session was created for the class,
and SQLite integrity and foreign-key checks passed (screenshots 38, 39).

Legacy import on the same profile (2026-09-10): launching the rebuilt app logged
"legacy study import: 1 imported, 0 already imported, 0 retained for recovery,
0 open". The skipped 9 September day now exists as a `daily_routine` runtime
session under its original `primary-…` ID with a `primary_import` crosswalk row
and a skipped result recording its last step; `integrity_check` returned `ok`
and Progress listed the same six sessions as before (screenshot 40).

## Durable appointments — 2026-09-10

Same isolated profile, upgraded to schema v9 on launch. With TypeScript (09:00),
JavaScript & Browser (09:30) and German (10:00) active on weekdays:

- A normal launch materialized one appointment per rule for the day, all `due`
  with the `+01:00` offset snapshot, and Today's scheduler read "due now" for
  the three classes (screenshot 41).
- Relaunching under `PRINCIPIA_DATE=2026-09-11` marked the three unstarted
  appointments `missed` and created the new day's three as `scheduled`. Today's
  agenda listed the missed rows with Make up and Skip beneath the new day's
  due rows (screenshot 43).
- Skip on the JavaScript row consumed it (`skipped`, resolved) in SQLite. The
  first build then reported "The skipped appointment could not be read" because
  the response lookup searched the agenda that no longer contained it; the fix
  returns the skipped row directly.
- Make up on the German row planned a runtime session whose selection records
  the appointment, claimed the appointment as `started` with the session
  reference, and opened the curated A1 lesson (screenshot 45).
- With the fix, Skip on the remaining TypeScript row consumed it and the agenda
  refreshed to no missed rows; both TypeScript and German runtime sessions
  stayed listed as resumable (screenshot 46). SQLite: two skipped, one started.

## Per-class focus ownership — 2026-09-10

Same isolated profile (schema v9 unchanged), launched with `--debug-day` so the
kiosk records the lock without seizing the display. TypeScript held a paused
advisory lesson and German an active one from the appointment checks:

- Today opened normally on the rebuilt app (screenshot 47). In the TypeScript
  Settings tab the new Enforcement section showed ADVISORY selected; choosing
  FIRM and Save enforcement reported "Enforcement saved" and SQLite stored
  `focus_policy` = `focused` on the class row (screenshot 48).
- With the app closed, the fixture's new `--skip` flag skipped the paused
  advisory lesson through the real skip path, and a fresh fixture lesson was
  planned and published with `focus_policy` = `focused` in its context
  snapshot (`ready`).
- Resume from the class header activated the session through the coordinator.
  The first build left the lesson header reading "pause class" because the
  store did not reload app state after activation (screenshot 50); start and
  resume now refresh after the lesson opens.
- Cmd-Q with the focused session active, then relaunch: the app logged the
  debug-day kiosk engagement at frontend-ready and reopened the lesson by
  itself at its saved reading position, with the header reading
  "focused · finish the check" (disabled) and the break-glass hatch visible
  (screenshot 51).
- Break glass showed the revised copy ("a focused class lesson is paused with
  its work kept, an in-progress daily session is marked skipped")
  (screenshot 54a). Typing the phrase and tripping the breaker paused the
  session (revision 6 → 9), created no daily-routine row for the day, and
  returned to Today with no lock and the lesson listed as resumable
  (screenshot 54).
- On the rebuilt app, Resume showed the disabled "focused · finish the check"
  header immediately. The desktop pass stopped there because the learner was
  actively using this Mac (the QA window kept leaving the active Space and a
  region capture showed their own work, which was deleted); the completion and
  skip release paths are covered by `tests/enforcement.rs` and the command-level
  release calls rather than by a native capture in this pass.

## Shared lesson shell — 2026-09-10

Same isolated profile, rebuilt app with `features/lessons/` (LessonShell,
LessonSession, KnowledgeCheck, LessonOutcome). The driver now refuses to act
unless the Mac has been idle, and ignores its own synthetic input.

- Launching with the focused TypeScript session still active re-engaged the
  lock and reopened the lesson in the shell: focused return control, class
  identity, stage rail (Learn · Practice · Check · Feedback), save state with
  the time budget, reading-size control and the hatch (screenshot 56).
- The rail's Check jumped to the retrieval gate; the shared check rendered the
  three frozen questions with lettered choices and objectives (screenshot 57).
  Choosing answers reported "answers saved with this lesson" (screenshot 58).
- Submitting moved the rail to Feedback, showed the corrections and result
  through the shared outcome component, restored the plain return control and
  removed the hatch: completion released the focus lock. SQLite: the session
  is `completed` at revision 13 (screenshot 59). Return reached Today unlocked
  (screenshot 60).
- The German lesson opened in the same shell with its mission, audio console,
  production (writing, speaking) before the check, and evidence badges in the
  header (screenshot 61); Practice on the rail scrolled to the production
  stage and the checkpoint recorded stage `practice` (screenshot 62). The
  first shell build rendered the paper reader with light text on the paper
  background; the paper now uses the scholar theme's foreground and
  background again.
- On the rebuilt app, Resume reopened the German lesson at its saved practice
  stage with the rail recomputed from the restored position (screenshot 64);
  a typed writing response and "pause and return" left the session `paused`
  with checkpoint revision 2 holding the response and stage `practice`
  (screenshot 65). Reopening at Learn showed the paper reader with dark text
  on the scholar paper and the writing badge restored in the header
  (screenshot 66).

## Path revisions and unit challenges — 2026-09-10

Same isolated profile. The desktop pass for this increment ran only while the
learner was away from the Mac; the driver's presence guard refused the first
attempt (the learner had returned), so the native record below covers what
could be captured. Behaviour is otherwise covered by `tests/classes.rs`,
`tests/challenges.rs` and the preview-parity tests.

## Delayed retrieval sessions — 2026-09-10

Verified through `tests/engineering_runtime.rs` (fresh and repeated material,
review count, mastery projection). The desktop pass is pending the learner's
absence: the driver refuses to launch while the Mac is in use.

## Language passes by phase — 2026-09-10

Verified through `tests/language_phases.rs`; the lesson's "This pass counts
when" line and the failed-pass explanation are rendered by the language
screen. Desktop pass pending the learner's absence.

## Bash reference lessons — 2026-09-10

Validated offline by `tests/fixtures.rs`; retrieval sets feed
`engineering::prepare_review` for the two Bash courses. No desktop pass is
needed for content; the Bash classes are not enrolled on the QA profile.

## Route revisions, badges and unit challenge — 2026-09-11

Same isolated profile on the bundle built from the Bash-fixture commit, driven
only while the Mac had been idle for over five minutes:

- The TypeScript overview opened normally (screenshot 72); the Curriculum tab
  showed the route denominators (required 0 / 35, coverage 0 / 35 core,
  revision 1 from Foundations, nothing set aside) and the note that bypassed
  and checked topics count toward neither (screenshot 73).
- Check out on the first topic produced revision 2 with the topic badged
  "Bypassed by choice · practicing" and an Include action, while other topics
  read "Upcoming · Required" with Check out (screenshot 74); Include produced
  revision 3. SQLite listed revisions 1, 2 and 3 for the class.
- Unit challenge on the Foundations phase opened the challenge panel above
  the map with its lettered choices, Skip and Save & next, and "Answers saved
  on this device" (screenshot 76). The window then left the accessibility
  tree before the result step could be captured (the process kept running;
  the attempt remains `active` and resumable), so checking out demonstrated
  samples is covered by `tests/challenges.rs` and the preview test rather than
  a capture. The route card on the overview sits below the metrics and was not
  scrolled into the capture.

## Changed curriculum and path review — 2026-09-11

Rebuilding the QA bundle with the new reference lessons changed every
engineering course's fingerprint, so the profile's accepted paths were stale:

- The first build left the desk on its loading screen with the toast "The
  curriculum changed. Review a new path before starting another lesson."
  (screenshot 79): the overview route summary's selection peek failed the
  whole app state. After the fix, Classes opened normally (screenshot 82) and
  the Starting point tab showed the accepted revision with "revise starting
  point" (screenshot 83).
- Revise opened the embedded setup with "Start from the foundations" selected
  and Review path / Save & return (screenshot 84); Review path showed the
  recommendation (screenshot 85) and Accept learning path recorded revision 4
  with the new fingerprint `379763f7…` while revisions 1–3 keep the old one
  (screenshot 86). The class row now points at the new revision, the overview
  shows "Next:" again and no curriculum-changed notice remains.

## Moving an appointment — 2026-09-11

On the rebuilt bundle, the TypeScript Schedule tab listed today's appointment
(`2026-09-11 09:00 · scheduled`) with a time input and Move beside it
(screenshot 87). Move with the time unchanged ran the command end to end: the
row's `updated_at` advanced and it stayed `scheduled` at 09:00 (screenshot 88).
Under `--debug-day` the launch agent is not rewritten, so the OS-level wake-up
for a moved time is covered by the command's refresh path rather than a
capture. The rule row above it reads "Due now" because the QA app runs under
`--debug-day`, where a scheduled appointment deliberately counts as startable;
the appointment row shows the real disposition, and a normal launch shows the
rule as due only when its appointment is due.

## After removing the retired daily routine — 2026-09-11

Rebuilt the QA bundle at the removal commits and reran the desk on the
isolated profile. Today opens on "Your study desk is waiting" with the next
class, the class scheduler card and the saved-sessions panel; the accessibility
tree has no "Saved daily session" row anywhere, and the cluster bar reads "all
systems nominal" instead of the old owed status (screenshots 89–90). Progress
still reads the whole history: eight sessions across the German and TypeScript
classes, including the 9 September day that the one-time import brought over
from the legacy tables, and opening a saved lesson from the history renders its
reader with the Lesson and Practice tabs (screenshots 91–92). Classes lists all
nine subjects with the class detail, its tabs and the route card, and both the
class settings and the desk settings render their runner and tutor controls
(screenshots 93–95). Resuming the saved German session opens the shared lesson
shell at `principia://languages/german/a1` with the stage rail, the pause and
return control and an advisory status line, and no escape hatch appears because
no class holds the desk (screenshot 96). Pausing returns to Today with the
session resumable again, and a full restart comes back to the same desk with no
errors in the system log (screenshots 97–98).
